You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
{
  "Profile":{ 
      "Name":"Kazuki Chinone", 
      "BirthDay":"1990/8/16", 
      "City":"Tokyo" 
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
